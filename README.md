# Crud-jsp

This is a crossword generator that creates a crossword given the size of the grid.
It is not that efficient and it can sometimes make mistakes. The algorithm that finds the words that are fitting to the grid puts the words to the grid by the words length.What i mean is the largest word would be the first one being solved.


## This is how it works;

 **Step1: Enter the grid size and click generate**
